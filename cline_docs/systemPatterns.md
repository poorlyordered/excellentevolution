## Frontend Architecture

### Component Architecture
- Server/Client Component Split
  * Root layout as server component for metadata
  * LayoutContent as client component for navigation
  * Auth pages as server components
  * Interactive features as client components

### Routing Strategy
- App Router (Next.js 14)
  * Route groups for authentication pages
  * Dynamic route handling
  * Middleware for auth protection (pending)

### State Management
- Planned Zustand Implementation
  * User authentication state
  * Assessment progress
  * Development goals
  * Session scheduling

### Navigation Patterns
- Conditional Navigation Display
  * Hidden for auth routes
  * Visible for authenticated routes
  * Responsive design with mobile menu
  * Active state indicators

### Component Patterns
- Layout Components
  * Root layout for global structure
  * Auth layout for login/register
  * Shared navigation and footer
- Page Components
  * Consistent page structure
  * Section-based organization
  * Status indicators
- UI Components
  * Card-based layouts
  * Progress indicators
  * Action buttons
  * Form elements

### Authentication Flow
- Route Protection (Planned)
  * NextAuth.js integration
  * Protected routes
  * Role-based access
  * Session management

### Data Flow
- Planned Implementation
  * API routes for backend communication
  * Data fetching in server components
  * Client-side state updates
  * Real-time updates where needed

### Styling Patterns
- Tailwind CSS Implementation
  * Utility-first approach
  * Responsive design classes
  * Component-specific styles
  * Theme consistency

### Error Handling
- Planned Implementation
  * Form validation
  * API error handling
  * Loading states
  * Error boundaries

### Performance Patterns
- Optimization Strategies
  * Server components for static content
  * Client components for interactivity
  * Route-based code splitting
  * Image optimization

### Security Patterns
- Planned Implementation
  * CSRF protection
  * XSS prevention
  * Secure authentication
  * Input sanitization

### Testing Strategy (Planned)
- Unit Tests
  * Component testing
  * Utility function testing
- Integration Tests
  * Page functionality
  * User flows
- E2E Tests
  * Critical paths
  * User journeys

### Monitoring (Planned)
- Performance Monitoring
  * Page load times
  * Component render times
  * API response times
- Error Tracking
  * Client-side errors
  * API failures
  * Authentication issues

### Deployment Strategy (Planned)
- CI/CD Pipeline
  * Automated testing
  * Build optimization
  * Environment configuration
  * Deployment automation
