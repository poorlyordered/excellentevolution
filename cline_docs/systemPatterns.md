# System Patterns

## Authentication System

Implemented a comprehensive authentication system using Clerk.com to handle user authentication. The authentication flow includes:

- **Clerk Authentication**: Provides secure user authentication with built-in best practices
- **Session Management**: Handled by Clerk's secure session system
- **Protected Routes**: Using Clerk's middleware for route protection
- **Environment Configuration**: Managed through Clerk dashboard and local environment variables

### Workflow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User registration with email (expandable to social logins)
   - Secure login with Clerk's components
   - Password reset and account management
   - Session handling and token management

2. **Security Features**:
   - Built-in password security and validation
   - Brute force protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Account lockout mechanisms

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Clerk components for UI
   - Middleware for route protection
   - Session management hooks
   - User data synchronization with MariaDB

## Email System

Implemented a transactional email system using Resend to handle all email communications:

- **Resend Integration**: Modern email delivery service with high deliverability
- **Email Templates**: React-based email templates for consistent branding
- **Event-Based Triggers**: Automated emails based on user actions and system events
- **Environment Configuration**: Managed through Resend dashboard and local environment variables

### Email Workflows

   - Coaching session reminders
   - Progress report notifications

2. **Security Features**:
   - SPF and DKIM authentication
   - Email verification
   - Anti-spam compliance
   - Delivery monitoring

3. **Integration Points**:
   - React email components
   - Next.js API routes
   - Event-based triggers
   - Email analytics and tracking

### Technologies Used

- **Clerk.com**: Primary authentication provider
- **@clerk/nextjs**: React components and hooks
