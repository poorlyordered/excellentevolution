# System Patterns

## Authentication System

Implemented a comprehensive authentication system using Clerk.com to handle user authentication. The authentication flow includes:

- **Clerk Authentication**: Provides secure user authentication with built-in best practices
- **Session Management**: Handled by Clerk's secure session system
- **Protected Routes**: Using Clerk's middleware for route protection
- **Environment Configuration**: Managed through Clerk dashboard and local environment variables

### Workflow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User registration with email (expandable to social logins)
   - Secure login with Clerk's components
   - Password reset and account management
   - Session handling and token management

2. **Security Features**:
   - Built-in password security and validation
   - Brute force protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Account lockout mechanisms

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Clerk components for UI
   - Middleware for route protection
   - Session management hooks
   - User data synchronization with MariaDB

### Technologies Used

- **Clerk.com**: Primary authentication provider
- **@clerk/nextjs**: React components and hooks
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and developer experience
- **MariaDB**: Database for user and platform data
