# Active Context: Excellent Evolution

## Current Work Focus
- Awaiting direction on next steps (Calendar integration postponed, Playwright testing paused).
## Recent Changes
- Fixed dashboard assessment list display (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`).
- Fixed header navigation active state highlighting (`frontend/src/app/LayoutContent.tsx`).
- Decided on Playwright for integration testing.
- Created Playwright integration testing plan (`testing/playwright-plan.md`).
- Installed Playwright dependencies in `frontend/`.
- Implemented Professional Development Plan Generator with:
  - Markdown template engine (frontend/src/lib/markdown-generator.ts)
  - Interactive viewer/editor component
  - Type-safe assessment data integration
- Added development plan types to assessment system
- Created development plan module structure
- Implemented basic AI Coaching Assistant chat interface:
  - Backend API route (`/api/ai/chat`) using Vercel AI SDK (Anthropic)
  - Frontend hook (`useAIRecommendations`) using `useChat`
  - UI component (`AIChatInterface`) for interaction
  - Page route (`/chat`)
- Updated architecture to use direct Prisma access from Next.js backend:
  - Updated `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` documentation.
- Implemented Development Plan Save/Export functionality:
  - Added `DevelopmentPlan` model to `prisma/schema.prisma`.
  - Created and applied database migration.
  - Created Server Actions (`frontend/src/actions/developmentPlanActions.ts`) for CRUD operations.
  - Updated `DevelopmentPlanViewer.tsx` component with save, update, and export logic.
- Implemented AI Refinement for Development Plans:
  - Created API route (`frontend/src/app/api/ai/refine-plan/route.ts`) using Vercel AI SDK (Anthropic).
  - Updated `DevelopmentPlanViewer.tsx` to call the API route and handle streaming response.
- Enhanced AI Coaching Assistant (`/api/ai/chat`):
  - Integrated user context (latest plan summary, assessment insights) into system prompt using Prisma and Clerk auth.
  - Resolved Prisma type import issues by updating packages and restarting TS server.
- Implemented "Analyze Latest Review" coaching flow:
  - Added `QuarterlyReview` model to Prisma schema and migrated DB.
  - Created `analyzeLatestReview` Server Action (`reviewActions.ts`) to fetch data, call AI, and return analysis.
  - Updated `AIChatInterface.tsx` with button, handler, and display area for analysis results.
- Integrated Quarterly Review System:
  - Created `createOrUpdateQuarterlyReview` Server Action (`reviewActions.ts`).
  - Created `ReviewInputForm.tsx` component for user input.
  - Added `ReviewInputForm` to the dashboard page (`/dashboard/page.tsx`).
  - The "Analyze Latest Review" flow now uses data entered via this form.
- Set up Playwright testing foundation:
  - Configured `playwright.config.ts`.
  - Implemented global setup (`global.setup.ts`) for reusable authentication state (requires env vars).
  - Created initial test file (`auth.spec.ts`) verifying authenticated access.
  - Further Playwright test implementation is currently paused.
## Next Steps
- Connect to calendar check-in feature (Postponed)
- Implement remaining Playwright integration tests (Paused)
- Await further direction for next feature development or testing phase.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Decision: Keep development plans as editable Markdown for flexibility
- Consideration: Balance between structure and customization in templates
- Decision: Use Playwright for integration testing (setup complete, implementation paused).
- Decision: Use direct Prisma Client access from Next.js backend instead of separate MCP server for database operations.
## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Pattern: Separate data processing (markdown generator) from presentation (viewer)
- Preference: Reusable components for development plan sections
- Pattern: Use Playwright's global setup for authentication state management in tests.

## Learnings and Insights
- Markdown provides good balance of structure and flexibility for plans
- Users may want to customize generated plans while keeping core structure
- Playwright offers robust features for testing modern web apps (auto-waits, cross-browser).
