# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
1. Assessment forms implementation and database planning
2. Webhook handling and email notification system for user events

### Recently Completed
1. Created webhook-server for local development
2. Implemented ngrok integration for local webhook testing
3. Set up Clerk webhook endpoint with signature verification
4. Configured webhook forwarding to local Next.js server
5. Added comprehensive documentation for local webhook setup
6. Implemented assessment input forms with cognitive functions display
7. Added darker text styling for improved readability in dropdowns

### Assessment Forms Implementation
- MBTI Assessment Form
  * Primary type selection with 16 personality types
  * Individual preference inputs (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) with strength indicators
  * Cognitive functions display based on type selection
  * Additional insights input

- Enneagram Assessment Form
  * Primary type selection (Types 1-9)
  * Wing selection
  * Instinctual variant ranking
  * Tritype selection (Head, Heart, Gut)
  * Additional insights input

- StrengthsFinder Assessment Form
  * Top 5 strengths selection from 34 CliftonStrengths
  * Strength manifestation descriptions
  * Domain category ranking
  * Additional insights input

### Database Planning Requirements
1. User Assessment Data Tables
   - MBTI Results
     * User ID (foreign key)
     * Primary Type (ENUM: 16 MBTI types)
     * Energy Source (ENUM: E/I) + Strength (1-5)
     * Information Gathering (ENUM: S/N) + Strength (1-5)
     * Decision Making (ENUM: T/F) + Strength (1-5)
     * Lifestyle (ENUM: J/P) + Strength (1-5)
     * Cognitive Functions (JSON)
     * Additional Insights (TEXT)
     * Timestamp

   - Enneagram Results
     * User ID (foreign key)
     * Primary Type (INTEGER: 1-9)
     * Wing (INTEGER: 1-9)
     * Instinctual Variants (JSON: ranking of SP/SO/SX)
     * Tritype (JSON: head/heart/gut numbers)
     * Additional Insights (TEXT)
     * Timestamp

   - StrengthsFinder Results
     * User ID (foreign key)
     * Top 5 Strengths (JSON array)
     * Strength Descriptions (JSON)
     * Domain Rankings (JSON)
     * Additional Insights (TEXT)
     * Timestamp

2. Required Database Features
   * Foreign key constraints for user relationships
   * Timestamps for tracking assessment history
   * Indexes on frequently queried fields
   * JSON support for flexible data storage
   * Validation constraints on enums and integers

### Current Implementation Details
- Local webhook server running on port 3001
- Using ngrok for public URL generation
- Webhook endpoint: `/webhook` on ngrok URL
- Forwarding to: `/api/webhooks/clerk` on Next.js server
- Using Svix for webhook signature verification
- Zod schemas for payload validation
- React Email for email templates
- Resend for email delivery

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Frontend (.env.local)
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_ZOQo9kBS0TSU5e3EXfJmexdZ8rFFCfNt
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key

# Webhook Server (.env)
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_ZOQo9kBS0TSU5e3EXfJmexdZ8rFFCfNt
PORT=3001
FORWARD_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/clerk
```

### Next Steps
1. Create database schema for assessment results
2. Implement API endpoints for saving assessment results
3. Add validation for assessment form submissions
4. Set up assessment completion email notifications
5. Implement coaching reminder system
6. Add progress report notifications
7. Configure email analytics tracking

### Current Challenges
- Testing webhook flow in local development
- Monitoring webhook forwarding success
- Ensuring proper error handling across both servers
- Planning efficient database schema for flexible assessment data

### Testing Requirements
1. Verify webhook signature validation
2. Test email template rendering
3. Confirm email delivery
4. Validate error handling
5. Test environment variable validation
6. Verify assessment data validation
7. Test database schema constraints

### Documentation Updates
- Added webhook configuration guide to systemPatterns.md
- Created .env.example with required variables
- Updated progress.md with completed features
- Added assessment form implementation details
- Documented database requirements

### Dependencies Added
- svix: For webhook signature verification
- @react-email/components: For email template components
- zod: For runtime type checking and validation
- resend: For email delivery

## Team Notes
- Webhook secret needs to be obtained from Clerk dashboard
- Email templates should follow brand guidelines
- Error logging needs to be monitored in production
- Assessment data should be properly validated before storage
- Consider data migration strategy for future schema updates
