  - Frontend hook (`useAIRecommendations`) using `useChat`
  - UI component (`AIChatInterface`) for interaction
  - Page route (`/chat`)
## Next Steps
- Enhance AI Coaching Assistant:
  - Integrate user context (assessments, dev plans) into prompts
  - Implement specific coaching flows (e.g., quarterly review analysis)
- Implement AI refinement for Development Plans using Vercel AI SDK

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Decision: Keep development plans as editable Markdown for flexibility
- Consideration: Balance between structure and customization in templates

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Pattern: Separate data processing (markdown generator) from presentation (viewer)
- Preference: Reusable components for development plan sections

## Learnings and Insights
- Markdown provides good balance of structure and flexibility for plans
- Users may want to customize generated plans while keeping core structure
