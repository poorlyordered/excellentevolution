# Active Context: Excellent Evolution

## Current Work Focus
- UI/UX refinement and polish based on user feedback (landing page, dashboard)
- Memory Bank documentation update
- Completed migration from MariaDB to PostgreSQL for all backend operations
- Awaiting further direction for next feature development (calendar integration and Playwright testing remain postponed/paused)

## Recent Changes
- Migrated backend database from MariaDB to PostgreSQL 17 (schema, environment, and Prisma config updated)
- Migrated all AI features to Grok 3 Mini Beta via Vercel AI SDK (`@ai-sdk/xai`)
- Updated landing page hero section:
  - New headline: "Unlock your Next Full Step"
  - Larger, centered subtitle: "powered by AI, driven by you"
  - Combined supporting text into a single paragraph
- Dashboard improvements:
  - Personalized welcome message ("Welcome {user.firstName}")
  - Added Clerk UserButton avatar for profile/account management
- General UI/UX refinements per iterative user feedback
- Committed and pushed all changes to remote repository

## Next Steps
- Await further direction for new features or enhancements
- Calendar check-in integration (Postponed)
- Implement remaining Playwright integration tests (Paused)

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Decision: Use PostgreSQL 17 for all backend data storage (migrated from MariaDB)
- Decision: Use Grok 3 Mini Beta via Vercel AI SDK for all AI-powered features
- Decision: Use Clerk UserButton for user profile/account management
- Decision: Keep development plans as editable Markdown for flexibility
- Consideration: Balance between structure and customization in templates
- Decision: Use Playwright for integration testing (setup complete, implementation paused)
- Decision: Use direct Prisma Client access from Next.js backend instead of separate MCP server for database operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Pattern: Separate data processing (markdown generator) from presentation (viewer)
- Preference: Reusable components for development plan sections
- Pattern: Use Playwright's global setup for authentication state management in tests

## Learnings and Insights
- PostgreSQL migration with Prisma is straightforward but requires privilege and schema adjustments
- Grok 3 Mini Beta via Vercel AI SDK provides a flexible, modern LLM integration path
- Clerk UserButton simplifies user profile and account management
- Iterative UI/UX feedback leads to a more polished, user-friendly product
- Markdown provides good balance of structure and flexibility for plans
- Users may want to customize generated plans while keeping core structure
- Playwright offers robust features for testing modern web apps (auto-waits, cross-browser)
