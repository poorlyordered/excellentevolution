# Progress: Excellent Evolution

## What Works
- Professional Development Plan Generator:
  - Markdown template engine
  - Interactive viewer/editor
  - Assessment data integration
- Assessment suite locked: Big Five, 16PF (optional), Holland Code, DiSC, TalentSmartEQ EI, Career Values Scale
- Self-serve flow with calendar check-ins conceptualized
- Tech stack updated to TypeScript, React 19, Next.js 15, Vercel AI SDK, etc.
- Secure database access via MCP server
- Basic AI Coaching Assistant chat interface implemented (API, hook, UI, page)
## What's Left to Build
- AI Coaching Assistant enhancements (context integration, specific flows)
- AI refinement for development plans (Vercel AI SDK integration)
- Save/export functionality for development plans
- Calendar check-in integration with Next.js API Routes
- Further UI prototyping and refinement
## Current Status
- Core development planning features implemented
- Basic AI chat interface implemented and ready for testing/enhancement
- Next milestones:
  - Enhance AI Coaching Assistant (context, flows)
  - Implement AI refinement for Development Plans
  - User testing for development plan and AI chat flows
  - Calendar integration
## Known Issues
- AI Coaching Assistant currently basic (no context integration, limited flows)
- AI refinement for development plans not yet implemented
- Export functionality pending
- Calendar feature usability untested
## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Added professional development planning as core feature
- Using editable Markdown for flexibility
- Separated data processing from presentation
