# Progress: Excellent Evolution

## What Works
- Professional Development Plan Generator:
  - Markdown template engine
  - Interactive viewer/editor
  - Assessment data integration
  - Save/Update/Export functionality (via Server Actions & Prisma)
  - AI Refinement via API route and Vercel AI SDK (now using Grok 3 Mini Beta)
- Assessment suite locked: Big Five, 16PF (optional), Holland Code, DiSC, TalentSmartEQ EI, Career Values Scale
- Self-serve flow with calendar check-ins conceptualized
- Tech stack updated to TypeScript, React 19, Next.js 15, Vercel AI SDK, etc.
- Direct database access via Prisma Client in Next.js backend
- **Backend database migrated from MariaDB to PostgreSQL 17 (schema, environment, and Prisma config updated)**
- AI Coaching Assistant chat interface:
  - Basic implementation (API, hook, UI, page)
  - User context integration (plan summary, assessment insights) in API
  - Specific flow: "Analyze Latest Review" (via Server Action)
- Quarterly Review System:
  - Input form (`ReviewInputForm`) added to dashboard.
  - Server action (`createOrUpdateQuarterlyReview`) for saving reviews.
  - Analysis flow uses saved review data.
- Playwright testing foundation:
  - Configuration set up.
  - Global setup for authentication implemented (requires env vars).
  - Initial auth test created.
- Landing page hero section redesigned:
  - New headline and larger, centered AI-powered subtitle
  - Combined supporting text into a single paragraph
- Dashboard improvements:
  - Personalized welcome message ("Welcome {user.firstName}")
  - NextAuth.js authentication (credentials provider, Prisma adapter)
  - Custom registration and login flows (API route, password hashing)

## What's Left to Build
- Calendar check-in integration with Next.js API Routes (Postponed)
- Implement Playwright integration tests based on `testing/playwright-plan.md` (Paused)
- Further UI prototyping and refinement for integrated features
- Subscription management integration (future)

## Current Status
- All AI features migrated to Grok 3 Mini Beta via Vercel AI SDK
- UI/UX improvements deployed (landing page, dashboard)
- **Backend database successfully migrated to PostgreSQL 17**
- Memory Bank documentation updated
- Awaiting further direction for new features or enhancements

## Known Issues
- AI Coaching Assistant could benefit from more guided coaching flows
- Calendar feature usability untested (Feature postponed)
- Playwright tests need implementation and execution with credentials

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Migrated all AI features to Grok 3 Mini Beta via Vercel AI SDK
- Migrated authentication from Clerk to NextAuth.js (custom registration/login, credentials provider, Prisma adapter)
- Added professional development planning as core feature
- Using editable Markdown for flexibility
- Separated data processing from presentation
- Selected Playwright for integration testing framework (setup complete, implementation paused)
- Changed database access from dedicated MCP server to direct Prisma Client usage in Next.js backend
- **Switched backend database from MariaDB to PostgreSQL 17 for improved compatibility and future scalability**
