# Progress: Excellent Evolution

## What Works
- Professional Development Plan Generator:
  - Markdown template engine
  - Interactive viewer/editor
  - Assessment data integration
- Assessment suite locked: Big Five, 16PF (optional), Holland Code, DiSC, TalentSmartEQ EI, Career Values Scale
- Self-serve flow with calendar check-ins conceptualized
- Tech stack updated to TypeScript, React 19, Next.js 15, Vercel AI SDK, etc.
- Secure database access via MCP server

## What's Left to Build
- AI refinement for development plans (Vercel AI SDK integration)
- Save/export functionality for development plans
- Calendar check-in integration with Next.js API Routes
- UI prototyping with Shadcn UI/Radix UI/Tailwind CSS

## Current Status
- Core development planning features implemented
- Ready for AI integration and user testing
- Next milestones:
  - Complete AI refinement implementation
  - User testing for development plan flow
  - Calendar integration

## Known Issues
- AI refinement not yet implemented
- Export functionality pending
- Calendar feature usability untested

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Added professional development planning as core feature
- Using editable Markdown for flexibility
- Separated data processing from presentation
