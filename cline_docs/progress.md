# Progress: Excellent Evolution

## What Works
- Professional Development Plan Generator:
  - Markdown template engine
  - Interactive viewer/editor
  - Assessment data integration
  - Save/Update/Export functionality (via Server Actions & Prisma)
  - AI Refinement via API route and Vercel AI SDK
- Assessment suite locked: Big Five, 16PF (optional), Holland Code, DiSC, TalentSmartEQ EI, Career Values Scale
- Self-serve flow with calendar check-ins conceptualized
- Tech stack updated to TypeScript, React 19, Next.js 15, Vercel AI SDK, etc.
- Direct database access via Prisma Client in Next.js backend
- AI Coaching Assistant chat interface:
  - Basic implementation (API, hook, UI, page)
  - User context integration (plan summary, assessment insights) in API
  - Specific flow: "Analyze Latest Review" (via Server Action)
- Quarterly Review System:
  - Input form (`ReviewInputForm`) added to dashboard.
  - Server action (`createOrUpdateQuarterlyReview`) for saving reviews.
  - Analysis flow uses saved review data.
- Playwright testing foundation:
  - Configuration set up.
  - Global setup for authentication implemented (requires env vars).
  - Initial auth test created.
## What's Left to Build
- Calendar check-in integration with Next.js API Routes (Postponed)
- Implement Playwright integration tests based on `testing/playwright-plan.md` (Paused)
- Further UI prototyping and refinement for integrated features
## Current Status
- Core development planning features implemented (save/export, AI refinement).
- AI chat interface enhanced with user context and "Analyze Review" flow.
- Quarterly Review input and analysis integrated.
- Database access pattern updated (direct Prisma).
- Playwright testing foundation established.
- Next milestones:
  - Calendar integration (Postponed).
  - Implement Playwright integration tests (Paused).
  - User testing for implemented features.
  - Await further direction.
## Known Issues
- AI Coaching Assistant could benefit from more guided coaching flows.
- Calendar feature usability untested (Feature postponed).
- Playwright tests need implementation and execution with credentials.
## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Added professional development planning as core feature
- Using editable Markdown for flexibility
- Separated data processing from presentation
- Selected Playwright for integration testing framework (setup complete, implementation paused).
- Changed database access from dedicated MCP server to direct Prisma Client usage in Next.js backend.
