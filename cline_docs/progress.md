# Progress: Excellent Evolution

## What Works
- Assessment suite locked: Big Five, 16PF (optional), Holland Code, DiSC, TalentSmartEQ EI, Career Values Scale
- Self-serve flow with calendar check-ins conceptualized
- Tech stack updated to TypeScript, React 19, Next.js 15, Vercel AI SDK, etc.
- Product renamed to Excellent Evolution
- Secure database access via MCP server with:
  - Parameterized query execution
  - Schema inspection tools
  - Connection pooling

## What’s Left to Build
- Gamification view (e.g., levels, badges) in React 19
- Calendar check-in integration with Next.js API Routes
- Sonnet 3.7 LLM integration via Vercel AI SDK for recommendations
- UI prototyping with Shadcn UI/Radix UI/Tailwind CSS
- Additional MCP tools:
  - Assessment tracking
  - Progress analytics

## Current Status
- Core database infrastructure complete via MCP server
- Planning phase: Memory bank updated, PRD in progress
- Next milestones:
  - Gamification design and calendar prototype
  - MCP tool expansion for analytics

## Known Issues
- Gamification may overwhelm users—needs simple initial design.
- Calendar feature usability untested for self-serve context.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Renamed from CareerCompass AI to Excellent Evolution.
- Shifted from coach-supported to self-serve with calendar check-ins.
- Tech evolved to Next.js 15/TypeScript stack from earlier proposals.
- Added gamification and future Udemy affiliate plans.
