# Product Context: Excellent Evolution

## Why It Exists
Professionals often lack accessible, self-directed tools to guide their career growth, relying on coaches or generic resources. Excellent Evolution offers a self-serve solution with validated assessments and AI insights to foster exceptional personal and professional evolution.

## Problems It Solves
- Uncertainty about personality, interests, behaviors, emotions, and values affecting career choices.
- Lack of structure for self-driven career planning and progress tracking.
- Limited gamified motivation for personal development.

## How It Works
- Users complete a guided assessment flow (Big Five → optional 16PF → Holland Code → DiSC → TalentSmartEQ EI → Career Values Scale), entering scores from external sites.
- AI (Grok 3 Mini Beta via Vercel AI SDK) generates personalized recommendations, visualized in standard or gamified views (e.g., levels, badges).
- Calendar integration schedules check-ins for goal updates and reflection.
- Progress is tracked quarterly, with exportable summaries.
- All user data and progress are securely stored in Neon (managed Postgres), with authentication and transactional email powered by Stack Auth.
- The platform is hosted and deployed via Vercel, with GitHub integration for CI/CD and preview environments.

## User Experience Goals
- Sleek, self-guided interface with mobile responsiveness (Next.js 15, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS).
- Intuitive flow with optional gamification (e.g., progress bars, achievements).
- Accessible design (WCAG 2.1) with clear calendar prompts.
- User avatar/profile management via Stack Auth.
- Transparent affiliate links for assessments and future courses (e.g., Udemy).
