## IV. Database Schema (PostgreSQL/Prisma)

```prisma
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  role      UserRole @default(CLIENT)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  lastLogin DateTime?
  isActive  Boolean  @default(true)
  assessments Assessment[]
  developmentPlans DevelopmentPlan[]
  quarterlyReviews QuarterlyReview[]
}

model Assessment {
  id                String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId            String
  type              AssessmentType
  rawResults        Json
  processedInsights Json
  createdAt         DateTime @default(now())
  user              User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

enum UserRole {
  CLIENT
  ADMIN
}

enum AssessmentType {
  BIG_FIVE
  SIXTEEN_PF
  HOLLAND_CODE
  DISC
  TALENTSMART_EQ
  CAREER_VALUES
}

model DevelopmentPlan {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId    String
  title     String?
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

model QuarterlyReview {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId    String
  reviewDate DateTime @default(now())
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```
