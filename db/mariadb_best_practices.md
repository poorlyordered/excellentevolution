# MariaDB Best Practices for Professional Coaching Platform

## Database Configuration Recommendations

### Security
1. Use strong, unique passwords for database users
2. Implement role-based access control
3. Regularly audit and rotate database credentials
4. Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
5. Use prepared statements in application code
6. Implement connection rate limiting

### Performance
1. Configure appropriate connection pooling
2. Use appropriate indexing strategies
3. Implement query caching
4. Set up slow query logging
5. Regularly analyze and optimize tables
6. Configure appropriate buffer and cache sizes

### Backup and Recovery
1. Set up daily automated backups
2. Implement point-in-time recovery strategy
3. Store backups in secure, offsite location
4. Test backup restoration periodically
5. Use MariaDB's native backup tools (mariabackup)

### Development Environment
2. Create separate dev/test/prod databases
3. Use database migration tools (e.g., Flyway)
4. Implement database seeding scripts
5. Set up local database performance monitoring

### Monitoring and Maintenance
1. Set up database health checks
2. Monitor connection pool usage
3. Track slow and problematic queries
4. Implement automated performance reporting
5. Regularly update MariaDB to latest stable version
